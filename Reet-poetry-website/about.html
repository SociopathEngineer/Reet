        <div class="about-section">
            <h2>What is Reet?</h2>
            <p>
                Reet is more than just a poetry website—it's a sanctuary for the soul's deepest expressions. 
                Born from the belief that every emotion, every tear, every moment of joy or sorrow deserves 
                to be captured in verse, Reet provides a space where words flow like rivers and emotions 
                find their voice.
            </p>
            <p>
                The name "Reet" itself carries meaning—it represents the rhythm of life, the flow of emotions, 
                and the eternal cycle of human experience. Just as rivers flow endlessly to the sea, so do our 
                emotions flow through poetry, connecting us all in the shared experience of being human.

        <!-- Our Mission -->
        <div class="about-section">
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                At Reet, we believe that poetry is the language of the heart. Our mission is to create a 
                space where people can express their deepest emotions, share their stories, and connect 
                with others through the universal language of verse.
            </p>
            <p>
                We strive to make poetry accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or experience. 
                Whether you're a seasoned poet or someone who has never written a verse before, Reet welcomes 
                you with open arms and an open heart.
            </p>

        <!-- The Creator's Story -->
        <div class="about-section">
            <h2>The Creator's Story</h2>
            <p>
                Reet was born from a personal journey through grief, love, hope, and healing. As someone who 
                found solace in poetry during the darkest moments of life, I wanted to create a space where 
                others could find the same comfort and expression.
            </p>
            <p>
                Poetry has always been my companion—through heartbreak and joy, through loss and discovery. 
                It's the way I process emotions, understand the world, and connect with others. Every poem 
                I write is a piece of my soul, and every poem shared on Reet becomes part of our collective 
                human experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                This website is my way of giving back to the community that has supported me, and creating 
                a space where others can find their voice, share their stories, and know they are not alone 
                in their emotions.
            </p>

        <!-- Why Poetry -->
        <div class="about-section">
            <h2>Why Poetry?</h2>
            <p>
                Poetry has the unique ability to capture the essence of human experience in a way that 
                prose cannot. It distills emotions into their purest form, allowing us to express what 
                often feels inexpressible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through poetry, we can explore the depths of love, navigate the complexities of grief, 
                celebrate moments of joy, and find hope in times of darkness. Poetry connects us across 
                time and space, reminding us that our emotions are universal and our experiences are shared.
            </p>
            <p>
                At Reet, we celebrate all forms of poetic expression—from traditional sonnets to free verse, 
                from haikus to experimental forms. Every voice matters, every emotion is valid, and every 
                poem has the power to touch someone's heart.
            </p>
